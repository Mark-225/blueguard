# Important
From here on out, Blueguard will **no longer receive any updates** ~~except for bugfixes~~. Thus, this plugin will never leave its alpha state.
The reason for this is that I'm currently working on a more modular approach that will allow multiple different Minecraft region plugins to be displayed on Bluemap using only one core plugin and one or multiple optional addons. Since there will be a module for Worldguard with the exact same features Blueguard provides, this project will soon be obsolete.

UPDATE: This plugin is now fully deprecated and will no longer receive **ANY** updates, not even bugfixes. Please switch to [BlueBridge](https://github.com/Mark-225/BlueBridge) for further support!

# Blueguard
A Bluemap-Worldguard bridge plugin to display your Worldguard regions on Bluemap

## How to use
Install Bluemap, Worldedit, Worldguard and Blueguard on your 1.13+ server and you are ready to go!

To configure various aspects of this plugin (default colors of Worldguard regions etc.), take a look at the config.yml in this repo or generated in your plugins/blueguard folder.
Most settings can also be configured per region using worldguard flags (further explanation can be found in the config.yml).

## Download/Installation:
You can either download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/Mark-225/blueguard/releases) section or clone the repo and build the plugin yourself using "./gradlew shadowJar".
